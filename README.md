[![build-ublue](https://github.com/vitalijusv/krokas/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/vitalijusv/krokas/actions/workflows/build.yml)

Custom Fedora Silverblue image for personal use.

Originally based on Universal Blue Startingpoint template, but was rewritten almost entrirely. This is somewhat simplified build, which may be easier to understand.

A secondary goal of this image is to reduce the size of updates (WIP).

For awesome batteries included images, check out the [Universal Blue homepage](https://universal-blue.org/) and the [main repo](https://github.com/ublue-os/main/), or [The Tinkerer's Guide on the website](https://universal-blue.org/tinker/make-your-own/) to make your own.
